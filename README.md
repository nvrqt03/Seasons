Season's App - created with React

This is a simple app that shows the approximate season where the user is located. It will ask the user's location, and based on that will display one of two screens - if its fall or winter where the user is, it will display one picture. If it is spring or summer, it will display another picture. 

If the user does not share the location, it will populate an error message.
